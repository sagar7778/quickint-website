                Mitti is an IoT platform which provides sustainable and reliable
                solutions to minimize uncertainty of yield production in
                agriculture. Until the invention of mitti, farmers from south
                Asia, Brazil and other parts of the world didnâ€™t have access and
                knowledge to control the most important factors which crops need
                in-check for their proper growth. Mitti is an Iot device and
                mobile application that helps farmers to measure,monitor and
                control soil moisture, humidity, nutrients requirements, air
                pollution, solar radiation which further process through
                algorithms developed by our deep research and consultation with
                several agro experts. The device is one time investment as it is
                a maintenance free product and powered by solar energy. On the
                other hand, Mitti app provides assistance to farmers about water
                and fertilizer requirements for different crops using device to
                optimize resources and get state of the art crop quality and
                maximum yield from the agricultural land. Main feature of this
                device is that it provides real time data which farmers can
                experience in their regional language.
